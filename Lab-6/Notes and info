Ansible is an open-source IT automation tool developed by Red Hat.
It allows you to configure systems, deploy applications, and manage infrastructure — all without manual SSHing into servers.

It works by connecting to remote hosts over SSH, then executing predefined tasks using modules or playbooks.

Core Concepts
Concept	Description
Control Node	The main machine where Ansible is installed. You run commands from here.
Managed Nodes	Remote systems that Ansible connects to and manages.
Inventory File	A file that lists the IPs or hostnames of the managed systems.
Module	A unit of work in Ansible (e.g., shell, apt, service, ping).
Ad-hoc Command	A one-line command to quickly perform a single task on managed nodes.
Playbook	A YAML file that contains multiple tasks to be executed in sequence.

Why We Use Ansible

Automation: Runs repetitive tasks without manual work.
Consistency: Applies the same configuration to all servers.
Agentless: Works over SSH — no installation on remote systems.
Scalability: Manage tens or hundreds of servers at once.
Reusability: Tasks can be written once and reused in Playbooks.
